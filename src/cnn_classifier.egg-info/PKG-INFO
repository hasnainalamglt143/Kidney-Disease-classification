# 🩺 Kidney Disease Detection using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect **Kidney Disease** from medical imaging data. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and classification of kidney-related issues using deep learning.

---

## 📌 Features

* 📂 Structured ML project with modular code (config, components, utils, pipeline).
* 🧠 CNN-based deep learning model for disease detection.
* ⚡ Data versioning and reproducibility using **DVC**.
* 📊 Experiment tracking with **MLflow** (optional).
* 🚀 Ready for deployment (can be turned into an API or web app).

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasnainalamglt143/KKidney-Disease-classification.git
cd KKidney-Disease-classification
```

2. **Create and activate a conda environment**

```bash
conda create -n kidney python=3.12 -y
conda activate kidney
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **(Optional) Install as a package**

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## 📊 Dataset

* The dataset should be placed in the `data/` folder.
* Update the dataset path in `config/config.yaml`.
* You can also manage datasets with **DVC**:

```bash
dvc pull
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Training the model

```bash
python src/cnn_classifier/pipeline/train_pipeline.py
```

### Running evaluation

```bash
python src/cnn_classifier/pipeline/evaluate_pipeline.py
```

### Using the trained model

After training, the model will be saved in the `artifacts/` directory. You can load it in Python like this:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

model = load_model("artifacts/model.h5")
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

---

## 🔬 Research & Experiments

* All experiments and trials are stored in `research/trials.ipynb`.
* Hyperparameters can be tuned via `params.yaml`.

---

## 📦 CI/CD & Deployment

* GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`) automate testing and deployment.
* You can integrate this with cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure, Render, etc.).
* HTML templates (`templates/index.html`) allow deployment as a **Flask/Django web app**.
